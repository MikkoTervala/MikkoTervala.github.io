# Home Automation

My extensive home automation system provides small quality of life improvements in our house. All systems and components run locally on my own servers, and there are no cloud components. 

### Examples of automation in use:

* My room lights gently start to turn on before my alarm clock to wake me up.
* Curtains open and close automatically based on my alarm clock
* During dark months, small low power lights provide light to move around the house. Brightness is automatically controlled based on the sun and time but can be overridden by switches.
* Air conditioning in each room is controlled intelligently based on multiple conditions and preferences set by users.

### User interface for all air conditioning units and temperatures from those rooms
