This thing here is my pride and joy. Itâ€™s built completely from scratch, I even glued together the deck from sheets of plywood. Battery and electronics housings are designed by me and 3d printed from PETG plastic. The longboard has gone through multiple rebuilds during the years, and almost all components have been upgraded at some point.

### Current specifications:
* High torque brushless DC motor with up to 3500W of power
* 36V 7.8Ah 280Wh battery with a maximum output power of 2000W. Built from 18650 battery cells
* Range of approximately 15km
* Top speed depends on gearing, currently 35km/h
