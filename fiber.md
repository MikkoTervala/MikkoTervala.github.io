# DIY Fiber Internet

![Fiber burrial](\assets\fiber_1.jpg)

Fast wired internet connections can accumulate quite high costs, especially when installed into old houses. That’s why when I heard our neighbors where offered fiber internet to be installed during electricity grid work, I offered to finance half of the cost if I could tap into the same fiber. I dug my own fiber from our neighbor’s basement to ours and installed the required equipment in both ends. Now we both enjoy the fastest connection available, at half the cost of individual subscriptions.
