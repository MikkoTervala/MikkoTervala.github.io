# Automated Greenhouse

My automatic watering system keeps my mother’s greenhouse perfectly irrigated even when nobody is home. It’s composed of multiple zones, allowing adjustable watering for multiple types of plants. Every year the system has been iterated on. Previously it has used a local rainwater collection system and a liquid fertilizer injection system. This year’s version utilizes utility water for simplicity with motorized mains cutoff and usage metering for safety. User interface for the system is provided in my home automation system, where my mom makes adjustments to the system.
